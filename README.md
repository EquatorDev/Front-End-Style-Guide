# Front End Style Guide

The following is a first draft of front end development style guide which should be followed when developing websites for Equator.

Rules have exceptions. Use the common sense you got from your mother as to whether they actually do apply an a given situation.

1. [HTML](#html)
2. [CSS](#css)

<a id="#html"></a>
## HTML

### Closing tags
Close your tags. It's tidier and easier to read and identify nesting.

### Images
Don't forget your alt tags which should be a concise description of what the image shows. Forgetting to do so fails to meet accessibility standards.   

### Presentational Tags

The &lt;b&gt; and &lt;i&gt; tags make your text bold and italic respectively. However, these are presentational tags and the styling should be handled by font-weight and font-style in your CSS. If you need highlighting use &lt;strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt; instead.

Using the &lt;center&gt; is bad practise because it has no other meaning other than making the text center. Leave the styling to your CSS.

### UL or OL

Lists where order is important use the OL tag.
